Recommendation
1. The data suggests that people in certain occupations (e.g., Lawyers) have poorer credit scores. The model could benefit from incorporating occupation-related data and understanding how certain professions correlate with credit behavior.
2. Since 45% of people have a standard credit mix, the model should consider how different types of credit contribute to the overall score.
3. The observation that people with higher income have not necessarily paid the minimum amount suggests that income alone is not a reliable indicator of creditworthiness.
4. The observation that the average monthly balance is lowest in May and higher in January indicates seasonal trends. We should adjust the model to account for seasonal variations.
5. Positive correlation between income and other financial metrics indicates that higher income usually comes with higher monthly inhand salary and investment amounts. However, this does not always correlate with better credit scores if debt management is not addressed.
6. Incorporating financial management factors such as investment behavior, and debt management into the credit scoring model can provide a more holistic view of an individual's financial health.
7. Provide resources and education to help customers understand how different financial behaviors (e.g., minimum payments, loan types) impact their credit scores. This can help customers make informed decisions and improve their creditworthiness.
